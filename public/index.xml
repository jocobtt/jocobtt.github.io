      <description>Hello! This is me starting my blog. I am wanting to use this space as a way to share some things that I am learning.
Who am I? By way of introduction, I am an MLOps engineer with a background in statistics. I enjoy learning new technologies and concepts and this blog is one way I hope to better learn things myself. I am hoping to post about once a month but we will see if I can keep that cadence in the future.</description>

      <description>Howdy! Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Jacob and I am excited to share a little bit about myself with you.
I have always been passionate about technology and have been fascinated by the endless possibilities it brings. From a young age, I have been tinkering with computers and have enjoyed learning about the world around me and how tech can be used to solve problems. This curiosity and love for technology eventually led me to pursue a degree in statistics and start my career in the tech industry.</description>
