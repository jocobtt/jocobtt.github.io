# Howdy!

Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Jacob and I am excited to share a little bit about myself with you.

 
I have always been passionate about technology and have been fascinated by the endless possibilities it brings. From a young age, I have been tinkering with computers and have enjoyed learning about the world around me and how tech can be used to solve problems. This curiosity and love for technology eventually led me to pursue a degree in statistics and start my career in the tech industry.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects and have gained valuable experience in fields such as finance, education, marketing, and information technology. In my current role, I am an MLOps Engineer at Collibra where I get to work on exciting projects and continue learning every day.

In my spare time I enjoy running, cooking, biking, and being outdoors. Some of my favorite foods include Oyakodon, Daal, and chirashizushi. I currently live in the DC area and enjoy the access to public transit and the running trails that this area offers.

On this blog, I will be sharing my experiences, insights, and lessons learned from my journey in the tech industry. I hope that my stories and insights will be helpful and inspiring to others who are also interested in technology. In particular, MLOps, Cloud computing, Devops, and Data Science

Thank you for stopping by and I can't wait to share more with you!
