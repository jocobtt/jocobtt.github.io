# Hello! 

This is me starting my blog. I am wanting to use this space as a way to share some things that I am learning.

# Who am I? 
By way of introduction, I am an MLOps engineer with a background in statistics. I enjoy learning new technologies and concepts and this blog is one way I hope to better learn things myself. I am hoping to post about once a month but we will see if I can keep that cadence in the future.

On this blog, I will be sharing my experiences and lessons learned as I work on projects involving MLOps, DevOps, Finance, Productivity, Full Stack Development, and Data Science. I will also be sharing tips, tricks, and resources that I have found helpful in my journey. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions for me

I hope that you will join me on this journey and that you will find the content on this blog helpful and informative. Thank you for stopping by and I can't wait to share more with you!
