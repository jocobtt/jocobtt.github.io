# Hello! 

This is me starting my blog. I am wanting to use this space as a way to share some things that I am learning. 



For those who may not be familiar, MLOps is the practice of applying engineering and operations practices to machine learning projects. It aims to improve the speed, quality, and reliability of deploying and maintaining machine learning models in production. DevOps, on the other hand, is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information-technology operations (Ops) to shorten the development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

On this blog, I will be sharing my experiences and lessons learned as I work on projects involving these exciting fields. I will also be sharing tips, tricks, and resources that I have found helpful in my journey.

I hope that you will join me on this journey and that you will find the content on this blog helpful and informative. Thank you for stopping by and I can't wait to share more with you!
